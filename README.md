## Innovations 
To date, existing decentralized cryptocurrencies adopt either PoW consensus scheme or hybrid consensus model of PoW and PoS. However, these systems still encounter the issue of **very limited efficiency/throughput**. Meanwhile, upcoming quantum computers threaten existing classical cryptography which is the foundation of **blockchain security**. In particular, the quantum algorithm by [Shor](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2653075?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) for computing discrete logarithms breaks the ECDSA signature scheme used by almost all cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Decred and Monero. However, if post-quantum cryptographic schemes are equipped in these systems, the throughput of them will become worse and even unbearable.

Hcash project aims to build a **secure**, **efficient**, **robust** and **reliable** decentralized system. Highlighted features such as **newly-proposed hybrid consensus scheme**, **post-quantum digital signature**, **linkability** among various blockchain-based and DAG-based decentralized cryptocurrencies, **smart contract mechanism** and **post-quantum privacy-preserving scheme** will be proposed and implemented in Hcash eventually.

### Novel Consensus Scheme  
To deal with the performance issue, we implement a novel hybrid consensus scheme with **strong robustness**, **high throughput** as well as **sufficient flexibility** in Hcash. On the one hand, with a newly-proposed two-layer framework of block chain, significant improvement of the efficiency is offered without compromising the security. On the other hand, with a hybrid consensus model, both PoW and PoS miners are incentivized to take part in the consensus process, thereby enhancing the security and flexibility of the consensus scheme, and providing a mechanism that supports basic DAO for future protocol updating and project investments.

For more details, please refer to our [specific report](docs/research/design-rationale-of-the-consensus-scheme-in-hcash.md).

### Post-Quantum Features  
To address security issues stemming from quantum computers, we design and implement post-quantum solutions in Hcash. Our proposals achieve the following 4 features:  
+ **Compatibility**: Compatible with existing ECDSA signature solution;   
+ **Flexibility**: Support multiple post-quantum signature solutions that are thoroughly analyzed, assessed and proved by international cryptography research institutions, meanwhile their security and performance must be outstanding;  
+ **Security**: the post-quantum solution must be proved secure in theory, and side-channel attack proof in practice;  
+ **High performance**: Signing and signature verification must be fast. Most importantly, the public key and signature must be short.

Please refer to our [design rationale](docs/research/design-rationale-of-post-quantum-features-in-hcash.md)  and [technical report](docs/research/post-quantum-signature-schemes-in-hcash.pdf) for more information.

## Starting Hcashd
Hcashd is a Hypercash full node implementation written in Go (golang).

This acts as a chain daemon for the [Hypercash](https://h.cash) cryptocurrency. Hcashd maintains the entire past transactional ledger of Hypercash and allows relaying of transactions to other Hypercash nodes across the world.
The installation of hcashd requires Go 1.7 or newer.
* Glide

	Glide is used to manage project dependencies and provide reproducible builds. To install:
	```
	go get -u github.com/Masterminds/glide
	```
* Build and Installation
	
	For a first time installation, the project and dependency sources can be obtained manually with git and glide (create directories as needed):
	```
	git clone https://github.com/HcashOrg/hcashd $GOPATH/src/github.com/HcashOrg/hcashd
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/HcashOrg/hcashd
	glide install
	go install $(glide nv)
	```
    To update an existing source tree, pull the latest changes and install the matching dependencies:
    ```
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/HcashOrg/hcashd
	git pull
	glide install
	go install $(glide nv)
    ```

* Start running hcash full node service to synchrnoze blocks
	```
	hcashd
	```

* Start hcash solo mining
	```
	hcashctl setgenerate true x     # where x represents the number of CPU threads
	```

* Stop hcash solo mining
	```
	hcashctl setgenerate false
	```
